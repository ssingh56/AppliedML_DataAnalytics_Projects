IST707 Assignments

### HW1: We need to analyze employee_attrition.csv dataset provided. The dataset provides a variety of information about the employees, such as demographics, time on job, etc. and also if they will stay with or leave the company('Attrition' attribute 1(Yes)/0(No)).

### HW2: In this homework assignment, we are going to use Cluster Analysis (K-Means & HAC) and Decision Tree induction algorithm on a weather forecast problem. It is a binary classification problem to predict whether or not a location will get rain the next day.
Information about the dataset (Weather Forecast Training.csv):
• Location: The location name of the weather station
• MinTemp: The minimum temperature in degrees celsius
• MaxTemp: The maximum temperature in degrees celsius
• Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm
• Evaporation: The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am
• Sunshine: The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.
• WindGustDir: The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
• WindGustSpeed: The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
• WindDir: Direction of the wind
• WindSpeed: Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes
• Humidity: Humidity (percent)
• Pressure: Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level
• Cloud: Fraction of sky obscured by cloud This is measured in “oktas”, which are a unit of eigths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.
• Temp: Temperature (degrees C)
• RainTodayBoolean: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0
• RainTomorrow: The target variable. Did it rain tomorrow?


### HW3: In this homework assignment, we are going to use multiple machine learning algorithms, including naive Bayes classifier, K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine ( with both linear and non-linear kernel functions), Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier to build a disease diagnosis model. It is a binary classification problem to predict whether or not a patient has a certain unspecified disease.
Information about the dataset (Disease Prediction Training.csv):
• Age: in years
• Gender: male/female
• Height: in unit of cm
• Weight: in unit of kg
• Low Blood Pressure: lower bound of blood pressure measurement
• High Blood Pressure: higher bound of blood pressure measurement
• Cholesterol: three cholesteral levels
• Glucose: three glucose levels
• Smoke: 1/0 regarding if the patient smokes
• Alcohol: 1/0 regarding if the patient drinks alcohol
• Exercise: 1/0 regarding if the patient exercises regularly
• Disease: The binary target variable. Does the patient have the disease?


### HW4: In this homework assignment, we are going to use multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, multiple artificial neural networks and deep learning models with different architectures to build disease diagnosis models using the same dataset in HW3. It is a binary classification problem to predict whether or not a patient has a certain unspecified disease. You also need to combine the findings with HW3 results to come up with a ranking of performance for various machine learning models on this dataset.
Information about the dataset (Disease Prediction Training.csv):
• Age: in years
• Gender: male/female
• Height: in unit of cm
• Weight: in unit of kg
• Low Blood Pressure: lower bound of blood pressure measurement
• High Blood Pressure: higher bound of blood pressure measurement
• Cholesterol: three cholesteral levels
• Glucose: three glucose levels
• Smoke: 1/0 regarding if the patient smokes
• Alcohol: 1/0 regarding if the patient drinks alcohol
• Exercise: 1/0 regarding if the patient exercises regularly
• Disease: The binary target variable. Does the patient have the disease?
